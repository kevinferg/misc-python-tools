# Useful Python Tools
This repository contains utility functions that I always find myself rewriting across different projects.   
The tools included enable the following:

1. [Assembling gifs from Matplotlib figures](gif/)
2. [Printing 2D arrays as LaTeX matrices](matrix/)
3. [Plotting surfaces and point clouds in 3D](plot3d/)
