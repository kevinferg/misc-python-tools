### Miscellaneous Python Tools
This repository contains utility functions that I may want to use later on (usually for data visualization in Matplotlib)...  
The tools included enable the following:

1. [Assemble gifs from Matplotlib figures](gif/)
2. [Print 2D arrays as LaTeX matrices](matrix/)
3. [Plot surfaces and point clouds in 3D](plot3d/)
4. [Generate "radar charts" in Matplotlib](radar/)
5. [Interpolate an image to a point cloud](interpolate/)
6. [Rejection sampling for arbitrary multivariate distributions](sampling/)
7. [Create and plot hex grids](hexgrid/)
8. [Trim blank space around the border of an image](crop/)
9. [Export a Google Colab notebook as a pdf](colabpdf/)
