# Useful Python Tools
This repository contains utility functions that I always find myself rewriting across different projects, or that I may want to use later on.  
The tools included enable the following:

1. [Assembling gifs from Matplotlib figures](gif/)
2. [Printing 2D arrays as LaTeX matrices](matrix/)
3. [Plotting surfaces and point clouds in 3D](plot3d/)
4. [Generating "radar charts" in Matplotlib](radar/)
5. [Interpolate an image to a point cloud](interpolate/)
