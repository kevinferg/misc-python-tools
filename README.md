# Useful Python Tools
This repository contains utility functions that I always find myself rewriting across different projects.   
The tools included enable the following:

1. Assembling gifs from Matplotlib figures
2. Printing 2D arrays as LaTeX matrices
3. Plotting surfaces and point clouds in 3D
